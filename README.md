# histogram_equalization
histogram equalization + a bunch of other CV stuff

This is a project I undertook as a first foray into the world of computer vision and image processing techniques. Contained within the repository are all of the programs I used to carry out the investigation, including my implementation of the histogram equalization technique, as well as the code that ran the actual experiment. A complete write-up of the process & results can be found in "Results.pdf".
